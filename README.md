# weave

## Assumptions
This assumes that Docker is installed. I used Docker version
`Docker version 19.03.8, build afacb8b` but anything recent should work. No promises for older versions.

## Run instructions
`./run.sh [root directory] [port]`

By default, this uses the current directory as default and runs on port 8000.
